There are two types of models:

1. Language Models: It takes text as input, Model process it then return back a text output.

2. Embedding models: It takes text as input, Model process it then return back some series of numbers (known as Embeddings or vectors) with represents the input text.

Further Language Models are divided into two types:

1. LLMs: General purpose models used for plain text generation.
      --> Training data - General text(books, articles)
      --> Memory & context - No built-in memory
      --> Role awareness - No understanding of "user" and "assistance" role
      --> Examples - GPT-3, Llama-2-7B, Mistral-7B, OPT-1.3B
      --> Use cases- Text generation, summarization, translation, creative writing, code generation

2. Chat Models: Language model that are specialized for conversational tasks.
      --> Training data - Fine-tuned on chat datasets (dialogues, chat conversation)
      --> Memory & context - Supports structured conversation history
      --> Role awareness - Understands "system", "user" and "assistance" role
      --> Examples - GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, Llama-2-Chat, Mistral-Instruct, Cloud
      --> Use cases- conversational AI, chat bots, virtual assistance, customer support, AI tutors
